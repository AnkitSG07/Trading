# Webhook Event Schema

Events published to the low-latency queue come from the standalone webhook
server's `/webhook/<user_id>` endpoint. The main ``app.py`` module no longer
exposes this route. Downstream consumers should expect
the event fields listed in the table and treat any additional fields as
optional extensions.

| Field        | Type    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `user_id`    | integer | ID of the user associated with the webhook token.           |
| `strategy_id` | integer or null | Identifier for the strategy verified via the webhook secret. May be `null` if no strategy is associated. |
| `symbol`     | string  | Trading symbol for the order (e.g. `NSE:SBIN`).             |
| `action`     | string  | Trading action, upper‑cased (e.g. `BUY`, `SELL`).           |
| `qty`        | integer | Quantity to trade.                                          |

The events are published to the Redis Stream `webhook_events` and are
validated using Marshmallow in `services/webhook_receiver.py`.

## Webhook receiver service

For easier scaling the webhook endpoint is available only as a separate Flask
application in `services/webhook_server.py`. Start the service with:

```bash
gunicorn services.webhook_server:app
```

Because the server only validates and enqueues payloads it is stateless and
multiple instances can run behind a load balancer to handle high traffic.
Deployments should route all webhook traffic to this service rather than the
main application.

## Order consumer configuration

The order consumer waits for broker API responses before publishing a trade
event. By default it waits as long as the broker client's HTTP timeout
(``BROKER_TIMEOUT``—25 s if unset), but deployments can override this by
setting the `ORDER_CONSUMER_TIMEOUT` environment variable:

```bash
export ORDER_CONSUMER_TIMEOUT=2.5
```

This value applies to every webhook event processed, ensuring that a slow
broker does not block the worker indefinitely while still matching the
broker's own timeout.
